# String Format
# As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:

# age = 36
# txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
# print(txt) this will be giving us the error 

# F-Strings
# F-String was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.

# To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string literal, and add curly brackets {} as placeholders for variables and other operations.

age = 36
txt = f"My name is John, I am {age}"
print(txt)


price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price} dollars"
print(txt)

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)

txt = f"The price is {20 * 59} dollars"
print(txt)
