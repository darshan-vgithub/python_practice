# Arithmetic operators
a=7
b=4
c=a+b
print(c)

# Assignment operators:

a=4-2
print(a)
b=6
# b+=3
b-=3
print(b)

#comparison operators
d=5
e=6
print(d==e)
print(d>e)
print(d>=e)
print(d<=e)
print(d!=e)

#Logocal operators
print("logical operators")
a=True
b=False
print(a and b)
print(a or b)
print(not a)
